The first of those projects was a simple Tic-Tac-Toe game that would allow you to choose your color and save your score.", "This app mostly helped me to get familiar with creating user interfaces for the first time, and it allowed me to practice newly-learned python skills."];

There are plenty of these online, but I wanted to challenge myself to create the algorithm without any outside help. The app allows you to import text files with sudoku puzzles in them, and solve them instantly. You can also manually type your puzzles in and solve them from there.", "Overall, my early Python apps are filled with bugs and are in dire need of optimization, but I like to keep them as is to remind myself how much Iâ€™ve learned since then. And so, you can see them now, too."];
