I noticed I was spending a good deal of time writing cover letters specific to each job I was applying to. So, I made the Cover Letter Generator for MacOS.", "This app allows you to generate a unique cover letter for each application you submit. Enter your letter content and personal information once, and the app will store this info so minimal information needs to be changed for each application. You can program variables into your cover letter in the text editor by typing an asterisk and enclosing the variable name in curly brackets. The color and template can also be customized to ensure your cover letter stands out. Overall, this app has saved me a great deal of time when looking for jobs, and it taught me to use Swift to make more complex applications."];
